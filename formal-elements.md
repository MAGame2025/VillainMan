## סקירת משחקים קיימים
Superhero Simulator: Game that simulates being a superhero and might have similar controls and feel but this game is about being the villain and destroying the city.

Hulk: It has a similar concept where you can cause a lot of damage to a city but it is a story game where my game is more arcady and can be enjoyed in short bursts.

<img src="images/HulkGame.webp" alt="Concept" width="400">

Prototype: A game where you have powers and can cause a lot of destruction. my game is different because it is more focused on destroying the whole city and cause even more chaos.

*In general this game will hit that felling of being free in an interesting sandbox causing destructions and being rewarded for it. It will have a light tone with simple graphics and maybe a little story tieing all the villains and heroes together.
