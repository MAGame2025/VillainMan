**Level Design**

VillainMan is a third-person arcade destruction game where each level focuses on superhero-scale movement, and enviormental destruction. Levels are handcrafted city environments, designed as contained arenas

filled with vehicles, police/military units, civilians, props, and destructible structures.

**Level Overview**

Tutorial Level – Introduces movement, villain abilities, destruction mechanics, and the damage meter.

Level 1 – Medium City – A small, simple city area with minimal resistance, low destruction requirements and a weak final hero battle.

Level 2 – Big City – A larger, more dense zone with more enemy response and higher destruction goals and a stronger final battle.

Level 3 – Large City – A large, complex city level with high destruction thresholds and a final powerful superhero boss.

**Tutorial Level**

The tutorial is a handcrafted area where the player learns: Basic movement,  Melee and ranged villain attacks, How destruction points work, Fighting basic cops/soldiers amd a simple "boss" enemy.

A weak “practice hero” at the end to demonstrate boss mechanics

The tutorial is fully guided and meant to introduce mechanics without any difficulty.

**Level 1 – Medium City**

A small city district designed to give the player their first true gameplay expirience.

might all take place at one military camp/ police station.

will mainly be a fun level with not much difficulty .

**Level 2- Big City**

A medium-sized handcrafted city featuring: Skyscrapers, Heavier traffic areas, Dense clusters of destroyable objects (buses, billboards, gas stations)

Maybe an underground parking entrances for enemy spawns

15 mins time limit with a mild difficulty regarding how much destruction the player needs to cause and a mildly difficult boss.

**Level 3*- Large City**

The largest and most challenging(not too much) level. This is where the player faces the “superman-style” final hero.

It will contain a full city map with buildings, dense traffic, civilians & enemies maybe even some easter eggs and secrets.

i will have around 30+ mins of gameplay content and will include the final difficult boss.
