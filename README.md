# VillainMan

VillainMan is an action arcade game where you play as a powerful villain trying to destroy a city before the hero arrives.  
You’ll cause chaos by destroying buildings, vehicles, and enemies to fill your destruction meter.  
If you reach enough destruction, you’ll face a hero in a boss fight.  
Gain gold and experience to unlock new villains, new abilities, upgrades, and cosmetics.  
The game offers fast-paced, fun destruction with a comic tone and multiple handcrafted city levels.
